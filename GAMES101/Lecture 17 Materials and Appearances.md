# Materials and Appearances  
## What is Material in Computer Graphics?
Material == BRDF  


## Snell's Law  
Transmitted angle depends on  
    index of refraction for incident ray  
    index of refraction for exiting ray 

## Snell's Window / Circle  

## Fresnel Reflection / Term  

## MicroFacet Material  
Rough surface  
- Macroscale:flat & rough  
- Microscale: bumpy & specular  

Individual elements of surface act like mirrors  
- Known as Microfacets  
- Each microfacet has its own normal  

### Microfacet BRDF  
Key:the distribution of microfacets' normals  

### Isotropic / Anisotropic Materials
key : directionality of underlying surface  
- Isotropic : week directionality  
- Anisotropic : strong directionality  

## Properties of BRDFs  
- Non-negativity  
- Linearity  
- Reciprocity principle  
- Energy conservation  
- Isotropic vs. Anisotropic  

## Measuring BRDFs
