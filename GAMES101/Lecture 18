# Advanced Topics in Rendering  

## Advanced Light Transport  

### Biased vs. Unbiased Monte Carlo Estimators  
- AN unbiased Monte Carlo techinique does not have any systematic error  
    - The expected value of an unbiased estimator will always be the correct value, no matter how many samples are used.  


- Otherwise, biased  
    - One sepecial case, the expected value converges to the correct value as infinite #samples are used -- call it consistent  

### Bidirectional Path Tracing (BDPT)  
 - recall : a path connects the camera and the light 
 - BDPT  
    - Traces sub-paths from both the camera and the light  
    - Connects the end points from both sub-paths  

- Suitable if the light transport is complex on the light's side  
- Difficult to implement & quite slow  

### Metropolis Light Transport(MLT)  

### Photon Mapping  

### Vertex Connection and Merging(VCM) 

### Instant Radiosity(IR) 


## Advanced Appearance Modeling  

### Non-surface models  
- Participating Media:Fog„ÄÅCloud  
- Phase Function : describe the angular distribution of light scattering at any point x within participating media.  
- Rendering  
    - Randomly choose a direction to bounce  
    - Randomly choose a distance to go straight  
    - At each shading point, connnect to the light
